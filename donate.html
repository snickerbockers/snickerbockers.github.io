      I missed out on great crypto bubble of '17.  Then I ended up buying high
      right before it popped, and now I feel like a dumbass.  But there is still
      hope!  You can make me feel better by throwing me the fruits of your
      sound crypto-currency investment strategies so I can look like I'm not
      irresponsible with money.

      (I don't actually need the money because I have a job that pays real well,
      so if you think there's someplace better to send your hard-earned DOGE
      then you're probably right.)

      Donations are much appreciated, and will be used to further inflate my
      ego.
