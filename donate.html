      I missed out on great crypto bubble of '17.  Then I ended up buying high
      right before it popped, and now I feel like a dumbass.  But there is still
      hope!  You can make me feel better by throwing me the fruits of your
      sound crypto-currency investment strategies so I can look like I'm not
      irresponsible with money.

      (I don't actually need the money because I have a job that pays real well,
      so if you think there's someplace better to send your hard-earned DOGE
      then you're probably right.)

      On the off-chance that Dogecoin is ever worth real money, then funds will
      be used to purchase one of those Japanese body pillows with the anime
      characters on them.  If there's any money left after that, I'll spend it
      on fulfilling my childhood dream of owning all the Saturn and Dreamcast
      games that were prohibitively expensive by the time I became a financially
      solvent adult.
